- [Digital Channels] what does it mean by "We have this information in a monthly level"?
- [Digital Channels] if cus_value is only available once he/she applied, how can be know if we are sending the best offer?
- go over the entities.py
- ask what to simulate
	- come up with a performance measuring framework
		- how accurate are the probabilities
		- will not question how accurate about the cus_value and cost
	- how far were we and why
	- what could we do to simulate

- what does target population include?

- non-solicit: target without an offer id (target population)
- solicit: target with an offer id (target population)
- customer can be card/non-card member
	in each group, they can be solicit or non-solicit
		this provides 4 segments
- reengaging - customer with an active DPL (customer-products can take care of this)
- resoliciting - customer with a paid-off DPL (customer-products can take care of this)
	this provides 8 segments
